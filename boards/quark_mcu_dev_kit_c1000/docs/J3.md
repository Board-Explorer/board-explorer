Jumper J3 toggles the platform power source between the internal regulator and
direct external DC power [J4](#quark_mcu_dev_kit_c1000/J4).
The default setting is internal regulator and this setting must be used when
jumper [J5 pins 1-2](#quark_mcu_dev_kit_c1000/J5Pin12) are connected (USB source).

| J3    | Pin 1 | Pin 2 | Pin 3 | Description             |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------------------------|
| Internal regulator   |   x   |   x   |       | Platform power from internal regulator. This is the default setting and must be used when jumper [J5 pins 1-2](#quark_mcu_dev_kit_c1000/J5Pin12) are connected. |
| External DC input   |       |   x   |   x   | Platform power direct from external DC power source. Note the max power should be 4.2V, with this setting jumper [J5](#quark_mcu_dev_kit_c1000/J5) should be left open â€“ no shunt attached. |
