Located on the top side of the board, the low speed expansion connector (LSE) 
is a 26-pin header connector for low-speed I/O. The I/O can include I2C, SPI, 
PWM, I2S, and various UARTs and GPIO. The LSE connector provides signals 
to implement low-speed lures to connect to the board.

The LSE connector uses 0.1" (2.54 mm) male header pins in a 2 x 13 array,
for a total of 26 pins. Pin 1 is in the row closest to the power connector,
and closest to the board edge.

NOTE: All I/O on the LSE connector is at 3.3V levels.

**THE PINS ARE NOT 5v TOLERANT!**
