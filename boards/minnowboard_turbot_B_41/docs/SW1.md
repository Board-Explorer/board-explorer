# Switch: SW1

This component is referred to as **Switch 1** or **System reset button**.

When pressed, the system will perform a system reset by issuing the
reset command to the operating system.

If pressed and held, the system will enter into a soft-off state. In the
event that your operating system locks up and you want to reset without
disconnecting power, press and hold this button until the D2 LED turns off.
