**About the Intel® Atom™ processor E3800 series:** Formerly 
codenamed BayTrail, the series consists of [six SoC SKUs](http://ark.intel.com/products/series/78160/Intel-Atom-Processor-E3800-Series#@Embedded) ranging from one to four cores, 512KB to 2M cache, 
3W to 10W TDP, and frequency from 1.33GHz to 1.91Ghz. These 
SoCs are based on the Silvermont microarchitecture, utilizing 
Intel’s 22nm process technology with 3-D tri-gate transistors, 
which deliver significant improvements in computational 
performance and energy efficiency. The E3800 product family 
is the first SoC designed for intelligent systems, delivering 
outstanding compute, graphical, and media performance while 
operating in an extended range of thermal conditions.
