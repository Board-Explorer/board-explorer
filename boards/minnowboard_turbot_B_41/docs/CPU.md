The Intel® Atom™ processor E3800 product family is the first 
system-on-chip (SoC) designed for intelligent systems, delivering 
outstanding compute, graphical, and media performance while operating in 
an extended range of thermal conditions. These SoCs are based on the 
Silvermont microarchitecture, utilizing Intel’s industry-leading 22nm 
process technology with 3-D tri-gate transistors, which deliver 
significant improvements in computational performance and energy 
efficiency.

This SoC was formerly referred to as Bay Trail.
