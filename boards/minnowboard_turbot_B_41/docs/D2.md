# Connector: D2

This connector is referred to as **LED 2**.

D2 is the On/Off status indicator LED. At system initialization,
if the CPU is running, D2 defaults to being ON.

Once the system has completed booting, the LED may be toggled via the GPIO
interface via pin #360.

To learn how to control the D2 LED, see the [Turbot Blink](tutorials/Turbot-blink) tutorial.
