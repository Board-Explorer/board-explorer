The MinnowBoard Turbot uses a 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel 5V power plug with 
(+) positive center.

**You must only connect a 5V power supply. The system is not 12V tolerant!**

This plug provides power for all services on the board, including 
the CPU, powering USB ports, etc.

A minimum of 2.5A should be supplied. If you are using USB powered 
external hard drives, a 4A power supply should be used.
