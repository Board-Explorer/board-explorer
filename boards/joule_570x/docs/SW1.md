The general purpose button is available to be defined by the software developer. It is connected
to the BTN_N signal of the module. When the button is pressed, the BTN_N signal is shorted to
ground, driving the BTN_N signal to a low state. When the button is released, the BTN_N signal is
pulled high, to +VDD1 (1.8 volts).

Refer to the [Intel® Joule™ Module Datasheet](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-joule-module-datasheet)
for the function mapping of the BTN_N signal.
