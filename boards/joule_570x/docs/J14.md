Jumper block J14 provides the ability to selectively enable boot sources for the expansion
board, specifically, the ability to enable booting from the SD card or from eMMC.
Refer to Figure 6 for the locations of the jumper block.

The jumper must be installed prior to a power-up of the expansion board, as the state of the
jumpers is sampled by the module at the rising edge of the PMIC_PWRGOOD signal, during the
power-up process.

* Placing a jumper across pins 1 and 2 (top row) of J14 enables booting from eMMC.
* Placing a jumper across pins 3 and 4 (bottom row) of J14 enables booting from the SD card.

**Note**: The default configuration is no jumpers installed. The BIOS defines the boot order.
