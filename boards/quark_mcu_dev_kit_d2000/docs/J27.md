Jumper J27 allows the internal regulator to be activated when an external power
source is used (J26 jumper). The regulator will maintain a steady flow of 3.3V to the platform. If an external power source is being used then pins 1 and 2 on this jumper should be connected, if on board coin cell battery source is being used then pins 2 and 3 on this jumper should be connected.
