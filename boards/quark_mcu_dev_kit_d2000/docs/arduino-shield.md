The IntelÂ® QuarkTM Microcontroller D2000 Development Platform supports the familiar
open standard Arduino Uno Rev 3.0 physical interface and is mechanically compatible
with Uno Rev 3.0.

* Each functional I/O can be configured to provide the same function that is
supported on the Arduino Uno Rev 3.0 with the exception of the PWM
capability which can only be supported on IO6 and IO9.
* The developer platform supports 3.3V IO operation only and is not 5V tolerant.
* VIN Pin is not supported.
* The 6 pin ICSP Header is not supported.

The purpose of supporting the Arduino Uno Rev3.0 form factor is to enable rapid
hardware prototyping through leveraging the existing ecosystem of 3.3v Arduino
Shields or the Arduino compatible prototyping shields. Software compatibility of any
Arduino shield is not assumed and would be the responsibility of the developer to
produce the appropriate code.
